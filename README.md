Hi, I'm Liam O'Brien @ldobrien. I'm an undergraduate at
Middlebury College doing research this summer at UC Irvine.
My summer project is related to mathematics and applications
of machine learning. In particular, I'm working to model
physical systems using graph neural ordinary differential
equations (GNODEs)
