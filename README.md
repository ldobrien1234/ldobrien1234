Hi, I'm Liam O'Brien @ldobrien1234. I'm an undergraduate at
Middlebury College doing research at UC Irvine this summer.
My summer project is related to mathematics and applications
of machine learning. In particular, I'm working to model
biological systems using graph neural ordinary differential
equations (GNODEs).
